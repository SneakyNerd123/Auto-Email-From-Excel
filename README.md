# Auto-Email-From-Excel
If you have an excel file with names emails and other stuff you can send personal emails to those people. This code specifically checks if the colum called roommate agreements is no. If it is no it will pull their name and email. It will then send them an email addressing them by their first and last name and tell them to sign up for roommate agreements.
